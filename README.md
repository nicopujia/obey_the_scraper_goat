# Obey the scraper goat

## What's this?

This is a script that I made to automatically convert the free online version of the book "[Test-driven web development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html)" to a single PDF, so I don't have to buy the book if I want to read it offline.

## Illegal?

I don't think that this is "illegal" because the author made the content of the book public. I'm just moving it from one place to another.

## Download the PDF

From the releases section, or execute the script locally.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Install the requirements
4. Execute `main.py`
